# InfrasoundAnalysis

This repository contains all code to read and process MPXV5004 data in Python. The sensor is connected 
to Port A0 of an Arduino Nano. The voltage changes are then computed into pressure values as specified 
by the datasheet. The data is fatched via USB and preprocessed in Python.
